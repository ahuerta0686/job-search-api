# Job Search API

### Requirements

Assuming you already have Node.js...

You will need a MongoDB server without authentication running on `localhost:27017`. You can change this in the `config/config.js` file.

Don't forget to `npm install`!

### Running Locally

You can simply run

```
gulp
```

if you have `gulp-cli` already. You also get live reloading this way. If not you can run 

```
node app/app.js
```

from the root application directory
